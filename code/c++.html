               C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[11] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[11] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).

                C++ (pronounced "C plus plus") is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation

            <p>
              C++  Be it Windows, a web browser, your favorite game, or a video editing software, the uses of C++ can be found in almost all applications today. Here are some interesting areas where C++ is popularly used.

                <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    C++ is a fast and strongly-typed programming language which makes it an ideal choice for developing operating systems. Mac OS X has large amounts written in C++

                <h3>Games</h3>
                <p>
                    Since C++ is closer to hardware, game development companies use it as their primary choice to develop gaming systems. It can easily manipulate resources and can override the complexities of 3D games and multiplayer networking.

                <h3>GUI Based Applications</h3>
                <p>
                    C++ is also used to develop GUI-based and desktop applications. Most of the applications from Adobe such as Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. are developed using C++.

                <h3>Web Browsers</h3>
                <p>
                    Web browsers need to be fast in execution as people do not like to wait for their web pages to be loaded. This is why most browsers are developed in C++ for rendering purposes. Mozilla Firefox is completely developed from C++. Google applications like Chrome and Google File System are partly written in C++.
