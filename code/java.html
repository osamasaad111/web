                Java is a widely used programming language and is designed for the distributed environment of internet. It is a general-purpose programming language that is concurrent, class-based, and object-oriented. It is free to access and we can run it on all the platforms. Java follows the principle of WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere), and is platform-independent. It is also simple and easy to learn

                <h3>Mobile Applications</h3>
                <p>
                  Java is considered as the official programming language for mobile app development. It is compatible with software such as Android Studio and Kotlin. Now you must be wondering why only Java? The reason is that it can run on Java Virtual Machine(JVM), whereas Android uses DVK(Dalvik Virtual Machine) to execute class files. These files are further bundled as Android application Package(APK). With Java and its OOPs principles, it provides better security and ease of simplicity with Android.

                <h3>Games</h3>
                <p>
                  Java has the support of the open-source most powerful 3D-Engine, the jMonkeyEngine that has the unparalleled capability when it comes to the designing of 3D games. However, it does cause an occasional latency issue for games as garbage collection cycles can cause noticeable pauses. This issue will be solved in the newer versions of JVMs.

                <h3>Cloud-Based Applications</h3>
                <p>
                  Cloud computing means on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. It provides a solution for IT infrastructure at a low cost. Java provides you with features that can help you build applications meaning that it can be used in the SaaS, IaaS and PaaS development. It can serve the companies to build their applications remotely or help companies share data with others, whatever the requirement.

                <h3>Big Data technologies</h3>
                <p>
                  Java is the reason why the leading Big Data technologies like Hadoop have become a reality and also the most powerful programming languages like Scala are existing. It is crystal clear that Java is the backbone when it comes to developing Big Data using Java.
